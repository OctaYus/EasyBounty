- **ANSI Color-coded Output**: Terminal output is color-coded for easier readability.
- **Batch Processing**: Validate multiple domains from a list with a single command.
- **Customizable Output**: Save results to a specified output file for later analysis.

## Installation

## Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
python easybounty.py <list_of_domains.txt> <output_file.txt>
```

### Example

```bash
python easybounty.py domains.txt results.txt
```

### Command Explanation

- `<list_of_domains.txt>`: The path to a text file containing a list of domains (one per line) to be validated.
